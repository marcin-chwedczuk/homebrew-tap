# Marcin Chwedczuk's Tap

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install --no-quarantine marcin-chwedczuk/tap/<formula>`

NOTE: The `--no-quarantine` part is needed as I do not have Apple Developer ID. Fortunatelly all my software is open source and you can build it from sources if you whish.

Or `brew tap marcin-chwedczuk/tap` and then `brew install --no-quarantine <formula>`.

## Available formulas

* `iunrar` - A simple utility to open RAR files on macOS (currently does not support RAR 5, but most files on the internet are RAR 4's)

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
