# Marcin Chwedczuk's Tap

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install --no-quarantine marcin-chwedczuk/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap marcin-chwedczuk/tap` and then `brew install --no-quarantine <formula>`.

NOTE: The `--no-quarantine` part is needed as I do not have Apple Developer ID. Fortunatelly all my software is open source and you can build it from sources if you whish.
